          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>
            I started self teaching myself python at university and never stopped.
            I started on kaggle and have been building my OOP knowledge with larger projects since!

          <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>
            My masters dissertation was on clustering, a unsupervised machine 
            learning problem. It was an exploratory analysis of different clustering
            algorithms using python.

          <h3>Coding and the cloud</h3>
          <p>
            My job involves coding in golang and using the cloud.
            I enjoy poking around and trying new things
            like terraform, docker or playing with APIs.

          <h3>Public Speaking</h3>
          <p>
            I competed in a public speaking competition where I presented a tedX style 
            presentation for 12 minutes in front of a live audience. I came second
            and was celebrated for having the most creative speech!

          <h3>Charity Work</h3>
          <p>
            I love volunteering, from being a volunteer carer
            for children with special needs, to lead fundraiser at a prison rehabilitation 
            charity, to speaking about STEM at schools!

          <h3>Fitness</h3>
          <p>
            I am a certified gym bro, at time of writing I can deadlift 75% of my 
            bodyweight and my aim is to get to 125% of my bodyweight at the 
            end of the year.
